## About The Project

VandyPool is a Vanderbilt-centered carpool and rideshare application targeted towards students wishing to save/earn money from rides to and from the airport. This application allows users to register either as a passenger or a driver. As a passenger, users will be able to enter all applicable flight details such as departure time, arrival time, delays etc. They will then be able to view other students who are willing to carpool together to the airport or back to campus. As a driver, users will be able to sign up for different slots depending on their availability and drop/pick up students to/from the airport. All drivers will be paid a flat rate for each ride completed, with higher flat rates during “surge times”.
